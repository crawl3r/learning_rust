# learning_rust

A repository of rust projects and small tools that I have written for whatever reason. They likely have a point and cover a new topic, but if they aren't self explanatory I'll include a description below or in the dir.

### reader
A quick script that basically just reads a file line by line. I assume it doesn't load everything into memory at once, works like a stream instead. Single threaded but loops through rockyou nice and quickly (so far)!
